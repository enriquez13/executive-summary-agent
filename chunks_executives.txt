Opportunities, and Outlook
Assessment of performance versus targets
We communicate our financial targets on an annual basis. We also provide updates throughout the year as
appropriate. 2024 was a successful year for adidas and we performed significantly better than initially
expected, while the overall business environment was still characterized by geopolitical tensions and
macroeconomic challenges in several regions. Our strong top-line development reflected an acceleration
of brand momentum that broadened across markets, categories, and channels. Less discounting and a
higher share of full-price sales benefited our profitability levels, partially offset by continued investments
into marketing and sales. We were able to upgrade our guidance three times in the course of the year,

Currency-neutral sales to increase at a high-single-digit rate in 2025
We expect the company’s currency-neutral sales to increase at a high-single-digit rate in 2025, reflecting
continued double-digit growth for the adidas brand. Our increased focus on local consumer preferences
combined with a significantly better, broader, and deeper product range as well as much improved retailer
relationships will be the main drivers of our projected top-line increase. In addition, impactful marketing
initiatives will further add to our brand momentum and fuel sales growth. Having completed the sale of the
remaining Yeezy inventory in 2024, the company’s outlook does not include any Yeezy revenues in 2025
(2024: around € 650 million).
Significant growth expected in all market segments

Cost of sales increase moderately
Cost of sales is defined as the amount paid to third parties for expenses associated with producing and
delivering adidas products. In addition, own-production expenses are also included in the cost of sales.
However, these expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales. In 2024, cost of sales
was € 11,658 million, representing an increase of 4% compared to the prior year level of € 11,244 million.
This development reflects the company’s growth as well as less favorable currency rates, partly offset by
lower freight and product costs.
Gross margin up significantly to 50.8%
In 2024, gross profit increased 18% to € 12,026 million from € 10,184 million in 2023, while gross margin
increased 3.3 percentage points to 50.8% (2023: 47.5%). The...

driven by increases in both marketing expenditure and operating overhead costs. Operating expenses as a
percentage of sales were up 0.8 percentage points to 29.0% (2023: 28.2%). Operating profit in Emerging
Markets increased 18% to € 738 million from € 626 million in 2023, while the operating margin was up
0.3 percentage points to 22.3% versus 22.0% in 2023.
Revenues in Latin America increased 28% on a currency-neutral basis. In euro terms, sales in Latin
America improved 21% to € 2,772 million from € 2,291 million in 2023. On a currency-neutral basis, this
improvement was driven by strong double-digit growth in most Performance categories. In Lifestyle,
Originals and Sportswear also grew at strong double-digit rates.
