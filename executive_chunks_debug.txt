Opportunities, and Outlook
Assessment of performance versus targets
We communicate our financial targets on an annual basis. We also provide updates throughout the year as
appropriate. 2024 was a successful year for adidas and we performed significantly better than initially
expected, while the overall business environment was still characterized by geopolitical tensions and
macroeconomic challenges in several regions. Our strong top-line development reflected an acceleration
of brand momentum that broadened across markets, categories, and channels. Less discounting and a
higher share of full-price sales benefited our profitability levels, partially offset by continued investments
into marketing and sales. We were able to upgrade our guidance three times in the course of the year,

Cost of sales increase moderately
Cost of sales is defined as the amount paid to third parties for expenses associated with producing and
delivering adidas products. In addition, own-production expenses are also included in the cost of sales.
However, these expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales. In 2024, cost of sales
was € 11,658 million, representing an increase of 4% compared to the prior year level of € 11,244 million.
This development reflects the company’s growth as well as less favorable currency rates, partly offset by
lower freight and product costs.
Gross margin up significantly to 50.8%
In 2024, gross profit increased 18% to € 12,026 million from € 10,184 million in 2023, while gross margin
increased 3.3 percentage points to 50.8% (2023: 47.5%). The...
