With the Annual Report 2024, adidas communicates financial and non-financial information in a combined
publication. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the financial, environmental, and social
performance of adidas in the 2024 financial year.
The cover pages and visuals throughout this Annual Report are inspired by the ‘Plus One Effect’ – the
latest chapter of our ‘You Got This’ brand campaign. Introduced in 2024, You Got This puts the joy of sport
and its power as a great unifier at the center, as we want to counteract an atmosphere of pressure and
stress. Now, in 2025, we are evolving the narrative by highlighting the influence each of us has in uplifting
others in sport. It is about changing the game, the tone, and the outcome for someone else, transforming
self-doubt to self-belief and pressure to joy. We all need someone to make us believe. ► SEE OUR COMPANY
We publish our Annual Report exclusively in a digital format. It is available as a PDF and online version.
The Online Report can be found on our website. ► REPORT.ADIDAS-GROUP.COM
